# Inventory Management Mini-Project with Oracle, Unix, and Python

## Project Overview
This mini-project demonstrates an inventory management system using the Oracle database, Unix shell scripting, and Python. The project includes automating data transfer with a Unix script and generating inventory reports using a Python script.

## Project Goal
Develop a system to:
- Track product inventory in an Oracle database.
- Automate data import from a flat file using a Unix script.
- Generate inventory reports using a Python script.

## Technical Stack
- **Database**: Oracle
- **Scripting**: Unix Shell Scripting (e.g., Bash)
- **Programming**: Python

## Project Steps

### 1. Unix Shell Script
Develop a Bash script to perform the following tasks:
- **Schedule the Script**: Set up periodic execution using tools like `cron`.
- **Data File Transfer**: Copy the inventory data file to a designated server location.
- **Data Import**: Use Oracle's SQL*Loader utility to import data from the file into a database table.
- **Error Handling** (Optional):
  - Handle conditions like missing files or import failures.
  - Send notifications (e.g., email alerts) in case of errors.

### 2. Python Script
Create a Python script to:
- **Database Connection**: Connect to the Oracle database.
- **Data Retrieval**:
  - Query inventory data from the database (e.g., specific products or low stock items).
- **Data Processing**:
  - Process and format retrieved data for presentation.
- **Report Generation**:
  - Print reports to the console.
  - Optionally, write reports to a file or display them on a web interface.

### 3. Testing and Deployment
- **Testing**:
  - Test each component (Oracle database, Unix script, Python script) individually.
  - Perform end-to-end testing of the system to ensure seamless integration.
- **Deployment**:
  - Schedule the Unix script for regular execution to keep the inventory data updated.
  - Run the Python script manually or integrate it with the Unix script for automated report generation.

## Deliverables
- Bash script for automating inventory data imports.
- Oracle database setup with inventory tables and SQL*Loader configurations.
- Python script for querying and reporting inventory data.
- Documentation on how to set up and run the project.

## Success Metrics
- Accurate and timely data import into the Oracle database.
- Clear and actionable inventory reports generated by the Python script.
- Efficient handling of error conditions with appropriate notifications.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a web interface for real-time inventory monitoring.
- Implement advanced analytics to predict inventory trends.
- Expand support for other database systems.
